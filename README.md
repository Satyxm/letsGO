Welcome to **letsGO**, a collection of 306 Golang projects developed daily in 2025, exploring Go from it's core fundamentals to advanced system design.
---
## Introduction

This repository documents a daily commitment to developing Golang projects, each designed to be unique and progressively challenging. The goal is to deepen understanding of Go and backend engineering principles through practical application.

## Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own directory within the repository, following this sample structure:

```
letsGO/
  ├── March/
  │   ├── Day01_HelloWorld_CLI/
  │   ├── Day02_Fibonacci_Generator/
  │   └── ...
  ├── April/
  │   ├── Day32_RESTful_API_GorillaMux/
  │   └── ...
  └── ...
```

Each project directory includes(depending on the project):

- **README.md**: Overview of the project, including objectives, key concepts, and usage instructions.
- **main.go**: Primary Go source file.
